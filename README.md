# RoboticsUsingPython
This was my assignement for Robotics Course. We had to think,design and implement a Robot that would help the University. The main idea was a robot that would help the library staff return the books in the correct section of the library.
The AI algorithms that the robot uses is an A* searching algorithm with the heuristic being calculated via the Euclidean distance using a map of the library within the robots software.

These are some videos with the robot completing two tasks with the one containing the tasks of turnign around it-self to go to its target.
